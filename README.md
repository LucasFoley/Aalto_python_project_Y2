#Strategy Game / Dungeon Crawler


##Checkpoint2


##Current features
- Working GUI with attack button, special attack, and semi working text box
- Working player combat and special attack
- World map that gives which enemies are in which room and gives a text description of whats going on
- Basic unit class that handles all unit to unit interaction and stats involving the units such as HP and so on


##Manual
- Open RUN_ME.py from the scr folder and run it
- Press the play button to start the game
- Then select the character you want to play by pressing one of the 3 buttons
- There will appear an attack button and a use special button and a text box
- Pressing the attack button simply attacks each enemy for a set amount based on their armor
- Pressing the use special button will use the characters special move
- The text box prints out combat information and relevant story/progression details


##Schedule
- Currently I am way ahead of schedule and only have the enemy AI and special abilites to program
- There is still a lot of visual work that can be done and small improvements and features that can be added if they make sense such as a stats button and a small pop-up box that gives the player information about the characters before selecting them


##Change
- Overall the program still looks and follows the main idea
- The only change that has been made is that instead of having 3 ally characters at once now you can select one of the 3 at the start of the game
